# NEAR Open Shards Alliance (OSA)
Quickstart guide

Welcome to GuildNet! This initiative is completely unrelated with NEAR Foundation, and works thanks to the support of the most active node operators from NEAR Protocol community.

In practice, it is an additional network called GuildNet, where the genesis block and the faucets are owned by the community members and not the Foundation.

Why another network?
1. Bootcamp & training ground for validators new to NEAR
2. Community ran and governed network
3. Supports dApp dev cycle prior to TestNet
4. See NEAR sharding in action!


## Repos

We are using slightly-customized NEAR tooling, to allow them work on GuildNet:
- [nearcore](https://github.com/near-guildnet/nearcore)
- [near-cli](https://github.com/near-guildnet/near-cli) - We currently run our own version of NEAR-Cli ( 05/29/21 PR has beent submitted to MaiNet)
- [nearup](https://github.com/near-guildnet/nearup)

If you plan to run your node (and applications) on GuildNet, keep an eye on these repos!

## Servers

We also have servers running, to provide an easier experience:
- [https://rpc.openshards.io/status](https://rpc.openshards.io/status) to query the state of GuildNet
- [https://wallet.openshards.io/](https://wallet.openshards.io/) to generate and maintain your webwallet


## Docs

- If you're familiar with NEAR use the [quickstart.md](quickstart.md) to generate your GuildNet wallet and request for some tokens.

- New to NEAR or have a fresh server to setup checkout the [new_node_setup.md](new_node_setup.md) guide.
